# English Grammar Basics

- subject: the thing doing the action

## Word Classes

### Verb

#### Dynamic (action) verbs

Dynamic/action/event verbs describe a physical
action or activity, something external that can
be seen or heard.

> walk, laugh, swim, play eat, drink sing, dance, talk, say

Non-external actions that take place in our
minds and feelings. Verbs that describe mental
or internal actions are still dynamic verbs.
Theses include "process verbs," which describe
actions of transition.

> consider, guess, change, grow, live, endure,
> succeed, fail

#### Stative (state-of-being) verbs

Stative verbs descrobe a subject's state or
feeling, including things they like and don't
like.

> want, need, perfer, love, hate, like, dislike,
> seem, understand, know, believe, involve, realize

**You can't use them in the continuous tenses.**
Stative verbs stick to the simple tenses, or
occasionally use the perfect.

#### Verbs that can be dynamic or stative

> Perception words: see, hear, taste, smell, feel

When perception verbs are used as an **involuntary** action,
such as passive or unintentional actions,
they are stative.

When those same verbs are used for **voluntary**
action-specific, deliberate, and/or temporary
events-they are dynamic.

Likewise, some perception verbs have alternative
meanings, especially if they're part of expressions
or phrasal verbs. Often, this means they act as dynamic verbs.

> Romeo and Juliet had been seeing each other for just five days when they died.
